            <h3>Frontend Developer / Designer</h3>
            <p>Greetings! I'm Dushyant Panwar, and I'm a passionate Front-end Developer. With a blend of creativity, dedication, and an unwavering pursuit of excellence, I've embarked on a journey to create captivating and user-friendly web experiences.

                In the ever-evolving world of web design, I firmly believe that design is not just about aesthetics; it's about functionality and seamless user interactions. My mission is to make the web a more beautiful and user-centric place, one project at a time.
                
                My journey in the world of Front-end Development has been a thrilling ride, shaped by a combination of formal education and real-world experiences. Along the way, I've had the privilege of working on projects that challenged me, allowing me to refine my skills and adapt to the latest industry trends.
                
                My expertise lies in crafting responsive and visually stunning websites using cutting-edge technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I take pride in turning complex design concepts into pixel-perfect, intuitive user interfaces. One of my most rewarding experiences was Bootstrap and Wordpress.</p>
